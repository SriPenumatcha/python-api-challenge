# python-api-challenge


## Overview
This project involves analyzing weather data from over 500 cities worldwide. The analysis includes visualizing the relationship between weather variables and latitude using scatter plots and computing linear regression for each relationship. Additionally, the project utilizes weather data skills to plan future vacations. By leveraging Jupyter notebooks and the Geoapify API, the analysis extends to creating map visualizations based on city data.


## Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

-Jupyter Notebook
-Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, NumPy, hvplot.pandas, Requests

### Folder Structure 

The python-api-challenge repository consists of the following folders and files:

**WeatherPy**: Contains WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb files, along with output_data, .gitignore, and api_keys.py.
  WeatherPy.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file for weather data analysis.
  VacationPy.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file for vacation planning.
  output_data: Results after running WeatherPy.ipynb.
 .gitignore: Git ignore file to exclude sensitive information like API keys.
 api_keys.py: Python script containing API keys (not included in the repository for security reasons).
**README.md**: Overview of the project.

**python-api-challenge_screenshots.docx**: Provides screenshots of the analysis results obtained after executing `WeatherPy.ipynb` and 'VacationPy.ipynb'.

## Instructions
To run the WeatherPy.ipynb, follow these steps:

1.Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/SriPenumatcha/python-api-challenge.git
2.Open the WeatherPy.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook.
3.Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and view the results.
4.Review the analysis findings and conclusions and also view the output_data folder for cities csv file and images stored.
5.Similarly, open VacationPy.ipynb to perform vacation planning analysis.
6.Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and generate vacation planning results.
